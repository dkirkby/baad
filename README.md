# Optimal Coaddition of Binned Data

Combine individual observations of 1D or 2D data that satisfy the following conditions:
 - Each observation views the same static source.
 - Each observation is blurred by a known point-spread function.
 - Observed data is accumulated into bins (pixels) with known edges.
 - Statistical fluctuations in the binned data are uncorrelated between bins.
